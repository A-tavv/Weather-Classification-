#### **In this task**:
We used a dataset called MWD with four weather classes: 'cloudy', 'rain', 'shine', and 'sunrise' (represented as 0, 1, 2, and 3).
We applied three different models:
1. DenseNet 201v2
2. VGG16
3. ResNet 101v2

Each model was trained for 10 epochs. After training, we compared the results. also we plot training accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix for each model.
